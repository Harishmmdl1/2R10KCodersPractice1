                As an entrepreneur who’s constantly finding ways to help people
                reach greater heights in their career and an Ex-Oracle guy, I
                know EXACTLY what it takes to launch a career in the IT
                industry. The truth is your background or your degrees don’t
                matter! What matters is your skills, only your skills!

                A pioneer in Learning & Development, Praveen always felt
                disengaged with traditional education. He believes supplementing
                education with relevant and engaging experience would prepare
                students for careers in the tech industry. He currently leads
                the program design at 10000 coders and brings in all his
                experience in studying various programs in the west to India for
                your success.
